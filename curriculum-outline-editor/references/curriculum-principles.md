## 1. Curriculum Standards Reference

### CEFR Pre-A1 (Starters) — Target Level for Age 4-6
- Understand very simple instructions in familiar contexts
- Identify and name everyday objects, colors, numbers 1-10, family members, animals, food
- Respond physically to commands (TPR: Total Physical Response)
- Produce single words and short formulaic phrases ("What color is it?" "It's red.")
- No reading/writing expectation at this stage

### Chinese National Kindergarten Curriculum (3-6岁儿童学习与发展指南)
- 语言领域目标：喜欢听故事、诵读儿歌；愿意用语言表达；专注倾听他人说话
- English is a supplementary subject; immersion through play and song is the pedagogy
- Activity types: songs, chants, games, stories, crafts, TPR
- Duration: 15-25 minutes per session maximum

### CCSS Kindergarten Relevance (adapted for EFL context)
- Speaking & Listening: follow agreed-upon rules, ask/answer questions about topics
- Language: use common nouns/verbs; produce simple sentences
- Applied to EFL: ensure vocabulary targets align with conceptual categories children already know in Chinese

## 2. Language Authenticity Checklist

### Red Flags — Must Fix

| Issue Type | Example (BAD) | Fix (GOOD) | Rule |
|-----------|---------------|------------|------|
| Over-formal instructions | "Please be quiet." | "Shh!" / "Quiet please!" | Use short imperatives in classroom context |
| Unnatural greeting | "Good morning, how are you today?" | "Good morning! How are you?" | Remove "today" — redundant in greeting |
| Direct Chinese translation | "I very like apple." | "I love apples!" | Fix grammar + naturalness simultaneously |
| Wrong article | "I have a apple." | "I have an apple." | a/an rule |
| Unnatural verb collocation | "Do the song." | "Sing the song." | Use correct English collocations |
| Stilted question form | "What is your name, please?" | "What's your name?" | Use contractions; "please" sounds odd here |
| Redundant subject | "The cat, it is big." | "The cat is big." | No double subject |
| Unnatural praise | "Very good, you are correct." | "Great job!" / "You got it!" | Use natural classroom praise |
| Formal transition | "Now let us proceed to..." | "Now let's..." | Contraction + simpler phrasing |
| Abstract instruction for young learners | "Utilize the flashcards." | "Look at the cards!" | Age-appropriate verbs |

### Tone & Register for 4-6 Year Olds
- Warm, encouraging, playful
- Short sentences (5-8 words maximum for teacher talk)
- Lots of exclamations and enthusiasm markers (!!)
- Commands over complex explanations
- Repetitive structures are GOOD (predictability = comprehensibility)

### Functional Language Bank (地道课堂用语)

**Classroom Management:**
- "Sit down, please." / "Stand up!"
- "Listen carefully." / "Look at me!"
- "Repeat after me." / "Say it with me!"
- "One more time." / "Very good!"
- "Hands up!" / "Quiet down."
- "Let's start!" / "Time's up!"

**Praise:**
- "Excellent!" / "Fantastic!" / "Well done!"
- "You got it!" / "That's right!" / "Perfect!"
- "Nice try!" (for incorrect answers — encouraging)

**Transition:**
- "Now let's..." / "Next up..." / "Time for..."
- "Are you ready?" / "Let's go!"

**Songs & Games:**
- "Let's sing together!" / "Clap your hands!"
- "Touch your nose!" / "Point to the..."
- "Can you find...?" / "Who can tell me...?"

## 3. Vocabulary Recycling (复现) System

### Core Principle
A word is not "learned" from one exposure. Research (Nation, 2001; Read, 2000) suggests 10-15+ meaningful encounters for acquisition. For 4-6 year olds, spaced repetition within short cycles is essential.

### Recycling Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Max new words per lesson** | 4-5 (strict upper limit for Pre-A1 young learners) |
| **First recycling window** | New word must reappear within 2-3 lessons |
| **Recycling context** | Must appear in a NEW activity/context, not identical repetition |
| **Unit saturation** | Core theme words appear in ≥60% of lessons in the unit |
| **Spiral structure** | Each new lesson should contain 60-70% known vocab + 30-40% new |

### Recycling Structure Templates

**Template A: Linear Recycling (for short units, 4-6 lessons)**
```
L1: A(new) B(new) C(new)
L2: D(new) E(new) + A(recycle) B(recycle)
L3: F(new) + C(recycle) D(recycle) E(recycle)
L4: G(new) + A(recycle) F(recycle)
```

**Template B: Cumulative Recycling (for color/number units)**
```
L1: red(new) blue(new) green(new)
L2: yellow(new) orange(new) + red(recycle) blue(recycle)
L3: purple(new) pink(new) + green(recycle) yellow(recycle) orange(recycle)
L4: white(new) black(new) + purple(recycle) pink(recycle) + red(recycle)
```

**Template C: Theme + Function Recycling**
```
L1: cat(new) dog(new) + "What is it?" (function, new)
L2: bird(new) fish(new) + cat(recycle) dog(recycle) + "What is it?" (function, recycle)
L3: rabbit(new) + bird(recycle) + "I like ___." (new function)
L4: horse(new) + fish(recycle) rabbit(recycle) + "I like ___." (recycle)
```

### Recycling Audit Process

When reviewing a curriculum Excel, build a vocabulary tracking table:

| Word | L1 | L2 | L3 | L4 | L5 | L6 | First Appears | Recycled in |
|------|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----------|----|
| red  | NEW|    |RCYL|    |RCYL|    | L1 | L3, L5 |
| blue |NEW |RCYL|    |RCYL|    |    | L1 | L2, L4 |

Flag words that:
- ✗ Never recycled (isolated new vocab → at-risk for non-retention)
- ✗ Recycled too soon (same lesson or very next = not spaced)
- ✗ Too many new words in one lesson (>5)
- ✗ Long gap before recycling (>3 lessons without reappearance)

## 4. Age-Appropriate Content Guidelines

### Cognitive Development (4-6 years)
- Concrete thinking only — no abstract concepts
- Learn through doing, singing, moving (kinesthetic + auditory)
- Attention span: 10-15 min focused activity max
- Love repetition and predictability
- Respond to rhythm and rhyme

### Appropriate Activity Types per Lesson
- **Warm-up** (2-3 min): Hello song, greeting routine
- **Vocabulary Introduction** (5 min): Flashcards + chant/song
- **Practice Activity** (8-10 min): Game, TPR, craft, story
- **Cool-down** (2-3 min): Review chant, goodbye routine

### Vocabulary Categories Appropriate for Age 4-6
- Colors: red, blue, green, yellow, orange, purple, pink, white, black, brown
- Numbers: 1-10 (receptive), 1-5 (productive)
- Animals: cat, dog, bird, fish, rabbit, elephant, lion, monkey, bear, duck
- Food: apple, banana, orange, milk, water, bread, egg, cake
- Family: mummy, daddy, baby, grandma, grandpa
- Body parts: head, eyes, nose, mouth, ears, hands, feet, tummy
- Classroom: chair, table, book, bag, pencil, crayon
- Greetings: hello, goodbye, thank you, please, sorry

### Topics/Content to AVOID
- Abstract emotions with complex nuance ("frustrated," "anxious")
- Complex grammar metalanguage ("subject," "predicate")
- Text-heavy activities (these children are pre-literate)
- Culturally irrelevant content (Halloween forced into Chinese context without context-setting)

## 5. Common Errors & Fixes

### Error Category: Unnatural Lesson Objective Language

| BAD | GOOD |
|-----|------|
| "Students will learn the vocabulary of colors." | "Students can name 3 colors: red, blue, green." |
| "To master the usage of prepositions." | "Students can use 'on' and 'under' in simple sentences." |
| "Comprehend the meaning of body parts." | "Students can point to and name 5 body parts." |

Lesson objectives for this age should be:
- Observable and measurable
- Use child-friendly verbs: say, point to, sing, match, act out
- Specific (name the target words)

### Error Category: Unnatural Song/Chant Lyrics

| BAD | GOOD |
|-----|------|
| "The apple is red, very red indeed." | "Red apple, red apple, la la la!" |
| "I am looking at a big elephant." | "Big elephant, big elephant, stomp stomp stomp!" |

Chant principles:
- Strong rhythm (tap it out — must work)
- Repetition of target vocabulary
- Action verbs embedded (stomp, clap, jump, wiggle)
- Rhyme when possible, but rhythm > rhyme

### Error Category: Inconsistent Recycling

Symptom: "yellow" appears in L1, never mentioned again until L8.
Fix: Add "yellow" to L2 and L4 warm-up review activities.

Symptom: L3 introduces 8 new color words.
Fix: Split across L3 and L4, reduce to 4 new + 2 review per lesson.
